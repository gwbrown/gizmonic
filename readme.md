# Gizmonic Institue of Worthless Experiments

This repository contains various experiments in programming, which
probably aren't really worth much. None of this is guaranteed to run,
especially on anyone's system but mine. You may or may not find any of
it useful.

Unless otherwise noted, code in this repo is MIT licensed (see
